An Activity is linked through a qualifiedAssociation to Associations, to describe the role of agents, and is linked through qualifiedUsage to Usages to describe the role of other entities used as part of the activity. Moreover, each Activity includes optional startedAtTime and endedAtTime properties. When using Activity to capture how an entity was derived, it is expected that any additional information needed will be attached as annotations. This may include software settings or textual notes. Activities can also be linked together using the wasInformedBy relationship to provide dependency without explicitly specifying start and end times. " alt="" coords="5,931,152,1097"/>
